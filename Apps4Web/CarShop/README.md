# Car Shop

* Here is another project of mine, which is still under development, but I can say that this will be the actual view of the future (hopefully RESTful) web application.

* The idea behind is that you will be able to create custom car brands, using the button pane, which could be later added to an HTML table and exported in CSV format.

* There is also an option to buy the desired brand, model or part for a certain price, which could possibly redirect to an online warehouse or a car selling platform, in order to ease a future deal for the selected item.

* As this is still a prototype, any future ideas or suggestions are greatly welcome.
