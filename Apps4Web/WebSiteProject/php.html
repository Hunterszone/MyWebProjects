        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web
        development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP
        reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team.</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for
        the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 markup, or it can be used
        in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually
        processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
        The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data,
        including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be
        used to implement standalone graphical applications.</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
        software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every
        operating system and platform, free of charge.</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Early history</p>
        <h1>History Introduction</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Rasmus Lerdorf (left), who wrote the original Common Gateway
        Interface (CGI) component, together with Andi Gutmans (middle) and Zeev Suraski (right), who rewrote the parser that formed
        PHP 3. PHP development began in 1995 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which
        he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and
        called this implementation &quot;Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter&quot; or PHP/FI. PHP/FI could help to build simple,
        dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and to improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of
        PHP/FI as &quot;Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0&quot; on the Usenet discussion group
        comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on June 8, 1995. This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has as of
        2013. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl
        but was simpler, more limited and less consistent. Lerdorf did not intend the early PHP to become a new programming
        language, but it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: &quot;I don‚Äôt know how to stop it, there was never
        any intent to write a programming language. I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept
        adding the next logical step on the way.&quot; A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing,
        officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997. The fact that PHP lacked an original overall design but instead developed
        organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the
        function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was &quot;wrapping&quot;, while in some very early
        versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve
        the distribution of hash values.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP 3 and 4</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed
        the base of PHP 3, changing the language&#39;s name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards,
        public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of
        PHP&#39;s core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. On May 22,
        2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released. As of August 2008 this branch reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is no
        longer under development nor will any security updates be released.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP 5</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">On July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine
        II. PHP 5 included new features such as improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO)
        extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance
        enhancements. In 2008 PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from PHP
        and was added in version 5.3. Many high-profile open-source projects ceased to support PHP 4 in new code as of February 5,
        2008, because of the GoPHP5 initiative, provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4 to
        PHP 5. Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, either by
        building them from the PHP source code, or by using pre-built binaries. For the PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the only
        available Microsoft Windows binary distributions were 32-bit x86 builds, requiring Windows 32-bit compatibility mode while
        using Internet Information Services (IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. PHP version 5.5 made the 64-bit x86-64 builds
        available for Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP 6 and Unicode</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP has received criticism due to lacking native Unicode support at
        the core language level, instead only supporting byte strings. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated
        to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and
        representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language
        and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in
        development. However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from
        conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3
        release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP 6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the
        project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining
        non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure re-binding.[ Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed
        for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.</p>
        <h1 style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">PHP 7</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, which
        was numbered PHP 7. The numbering of this version involved some debate. While the PHP 6 Unicode experiment had never been
        released, several articles and book titles referenced the PHP 6 name, which might have caused confusion if a new release
        were to reuse the name. After a vote, the name PHP 7 was chosen. The foundation of PHP 7 is a PHP branch that was
        originally dubbed PHP next generation (phpng). It was authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov, and aimed to
        optimize PHP performance by refactoring the Zend Engine to use more compact data structures with improved cache locality
        while retaining near-complete language compatibility. As of 14 July 2014, WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the
        main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost 100% increase in performance. Changes from php are also
        expected to make it easier to improve performance in the future, as more compact data structures and other changes are seen
        as better suited for a successful migration to a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Because of the significant changes, the
        reworked Zend Engine is called Zend Engine 3, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP 5. Because of major internal changes in
        phpng, it must receive a new major version number of PHP, rather than a minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP&#39;s release
        process. Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an
        opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks, including wider use of
        exceptions, reworking variable syntax to be more consistent and complete, and the deprecation or removal of various legacy
        features. PHP 7 also introduced new language features, including return type declarations for functions, which complement
        the existing parameter type declarations, and support for the scalar types (integer, float, string, and boolean) in
        parameter and return type declarations.</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or
        standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has gone on to create a
        formal PHP specification.</p>

          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Stable: Since it is maintained by many developers, so when bugs
          are found, it can be quickly fixed.</li>
          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Powerful library support: You can easily find functional modules
          you need such as PDF, Graph etc.</li>
          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Built-in database connection modules: You can connect to database
          easily using PHP, since many websites are data/content driven, so we will use database frequently, this will largely
          reduce the development time of web apps.</li>

        <ul>
          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Security : Since it is open sourced, so all people can see the
          source code, if there are bugs in the source code, it can be used by people to explore the weakness of PHP.</li>
          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Not suitable for large applications: Hard to maintain since it is
          not very modular.</li>
          <li style="font-family:courier new; text-align:center">Weak type: Implicit conversion may surprise unwary programmers and
          lead to unexpected bugs. For example, the strings ‚Äú1000‚Äù and ‚Äú1e3‚Äù compare equal because they are implicitly cast
          to floating point numbers.</li>

      one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser. In
      terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to the C style syntax. if conditions, for and while loops, and function
      returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl. The following is an example of PHP for
      loop:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="k">for</span> 
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nv">$x</span> 
<span class="o">=</span> 
<span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="o">&lt;=</span> 
<span class="mi">100</span>
<span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="nv">$x</span>
<span class="o">++</span>
<span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="p">{</span>
    
<span class="k">echo</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;The number is: </span>
<span class="si">$x</span>
<span class="s2"> &lt;br&gt;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</pre>
      <h1>Data types</h1>
      <p>PHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either a 64-bit or 32-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language
      long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior is different from that of
      other programming languages.Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and
      binary notations. Floating point numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating
      point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean
      types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as
      in Perl and C++. The null data type represents a variable that has no value; NULL is the only allowed value for this data
      type. Variables of the &quot;resource&quot; type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically
      created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples
      include file, image, and database resources. Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including
      resources, objects, and other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the
      two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc
      syntax. The Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces
      and classes.</p>
      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <p>PHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these
      functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation. However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming
      conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above. Custom functions may be defined by the
      developer, e.g.:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="k">function</span> 
<span class="nf">myAge</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nv">$birthYear</span>

      <p>In lieu of 
      <a href="/wiki/Function_pointer" title="Function pointer">function pointers</a>, functions in PHP can be referenced by a

      defined. There is a 
      <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function
      calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class 
      <a href="/wiki/Constructor_(computer_science)" class="mw-redirect" title="Constructor (computer science)">constructor</a>
      functions called with the PHP operator

      <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr">
        <span class="nv">$y</span>
      </code>, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be

      </sup></p>
      <p>Unusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at
      runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP†5.0, for arrays since PHP†5.1, for 
      <a href="/wiki/Callable_object" title="Callable object">&quot;callables&quot;</a> since PHP 5.4, and scalar (integer, float,
      string and boolean) types since PHP†7.0.
      <sup id="cite_ref-scalar-types_51-3" class="reference">
        <a href="#cite_note-scalar-types-51"></a>

      parameters, preceded by a colon.
      <sup id="cite_ref-return-types_50-2" class="reference">
        <a href="#cite_note-return-types-50"></a>
      </sup> For example, the 
      <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP†7:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="k">function</span> 
<span class="nf">getAdder</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">int</span>

<span class="c1">// would also throw an exception</span>
</pre>By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter&#39;s type is int, PHP
would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would
convert them. However, PHP 7 has a &quot;strict typing&quot; mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls
and returns within a file.
      <h1>Object-oriented programming</h1>
      <p>Basic 
      <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> functionality
      was added in PHP 3 and improved in PHP 4.
      <sup id="cite_ref-about_PHP_5-8" class="reference">
        <a href="#cite_note-about_PHP-5">[5]</a>
      </sup> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language.
      Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.
      <sup id="cite_ref-php_5_objects_105-0" class="reference">
        <a href="#cite_note-php_5_objects-105"></a>

      <sup id="cite_ref-php_5_objects_105-1" class="reference">
        <a href="#cite_note-php_5_objects-105">[105]</a>
      </sup> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP&#39;s &quot;reference&quot; variables if it
      wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by 
      <a href="/wiki/Handle_(computing)" title="Handle (computing)">handle</a>, and not by value.</p>
      <p>PHP 5 introduced private and protected 
      <a href="/wiki/Member_variable" title="Member variable">member variables</a> and methods, along with 
      <a href="/wiki/Abstract_type" title="Abstract type">abstract classes</a>,

      <a href="/wiki/Final_method" class="mw-redirect" title="Final method">final methods</a>. It also introduced a standard way of
      declaring 
      <a href="/wiki/Constructor_(computer_science)" class="mw-redirect" title="Constructor (computer science)">constructors</a>
      and 
      <a href="/wiki/Destructor_(computer_science)" class="mw-redirect" title="Destructor (computer science)">destructors</a>,
      similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as 
      <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a>, and a standard 
      <a href="/wiki/Exception_handling" title="Exception handling">exception handling</a> model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added 
      <a href="/wiki/Interface_(computing)" title="Interface (computing)">interfaces</a> and allowed for multiple interfaces to be
      implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. 
      <a href="/wiki/Object_(computer_science)" title="Object (computer science)">Objects</a> implementing ArrayAccess can be used

      <p>If the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word 
      <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a 
      <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default 
      <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object&#39;s properties. If a 
      <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created
      object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the
      programmer can start with a by-value 
      <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/replica" class="extiw" title="wikt:replica">replica</a> of the source object and only

      <h1>Implementations</h1>
      <p>The original, only complete and most widely used PHP implementation is powered by the Zend Engine and known simply as PHP.
      To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as &quot;Zend PHP&quot;. The Zend
      Engine compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It
      is also the &quot;reference implementation&quot; of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP
      define the semantics of PHP itself. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is
      difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility. PHP&#39;s single-request-per-script-execution model,
      and the fact that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed
      to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time
      the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine&#39;s internal format by using an opcode cache,
      which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and
      compiling the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. Another
      example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension. While Zend
      PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are compilers
      or support JIT compilation, and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP
      compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following: HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) ‚Äì developed at Facebook and
      available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an intermediate language), which
      is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6√ó
      performance improvements. Parrot ‚Äì a virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently; Pipp transforms the PHP
      source code into the Parrot intermediate representation, which is then translated into the Parrot&#39;s bytecode and executed
      by the virtual machine. Phalanger ‚Äì compiles PHP into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode HipHop ‚Äì developed at
      Facebook and available as open source, it transforms the PHP scripts into C++ code and then compiles the resulting code,
      reducing the server load up to 50%. In early 2013, Facebook deprecated it in favor of HHVM due to multiple reasons, including
      deployment difficulties and lack of support for the whole PHP language, including the create_function() and eval()
      constructs.</p></div>
